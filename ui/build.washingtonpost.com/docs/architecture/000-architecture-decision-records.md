# Lightweight Architectural Design Record (ADR) Format

## Context

This project is growing to the size and maturity where documenting the decisions
made in its creation will be strongly beneficial.

Decisions are already being made in isolation without documentation and existing
documentation around decisions is dispersed and hard to find.

The convention of lightweight architectural decisions
[is set out by think relevance](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
It is set out in the form of an architectural decision record.

## Decision

For all architectural decisions in this project, an architectural decision
record will be created with a filename of `XXX-decision-title.md` where XXX is
the monotonically increasing number described in the linked document.

## Resources

Link any Discussions, Notion(s) and related PR(s)
