## When to use

**If you're using emojis, they should ideally meet all the following criteria:**

- Used as an enhancement (but not in place of words)
- Used sparingly
- Used when the overall tone of the experience is light

<Box css={{ position: "relative", paddingLeft: "$200" }}>
  <Box
    role="list"
    css={{
      // Space for custom marker
      "&::before": {
        content: '"○"', // Open circle as marker
        position: "absolute",
        left: "$100",
        fontSize: "$100", // Size of marker
        color: "$gray20", // Customize as needed (or set a color variable)
      },
    }}
  >
    <Box role="listItem">
      Emojis chosen should also be light in tone (i.e. confetti is OK;
      tombstones for a Halloween email, not so much)
    </Box>
  </Box>
</Box>

- Used when there's no chance of the emojis appearing juxtaposed with grim, serious articles

<Box css={{ position: "relative", paddingLeft: "$200" }}>
  <Box
    role="list"
    css={{
      // Space for custom marker
      "&::before": {
        content: '"○"', // Open circle as marker
        position: "absolute",
        left: "$100",
        fontSize: "$100", // Size of marker
        color: "$gray20", // Customize as needed (or set a color variable)
      },
    }}
  >
    <Box role="listItem">
      For example, Microsoft doesn't have flag emojis. Check to make sure your
      emojis convey what you're intending.
    </Box>
  </Box>
</Box>

## How to use

**If you use emojis:**

- Use widely recognized emojis that translate well across devices.

<Box css={{ position: "relative", paddingLeft: "$200" }}>
  <Box
    role="list"
    css={{
      // Space for custom marker
      "&::before": {
        content: '"○"', // Open circle as marker
        position: "absolute",
        left: "$100",
        fontSize: "$100", // Size of marker
        color: "$gray20", // Customize as needed (or set a color variable)
      },
    }}
  >
    <Box role="listItem">
      For example, Microsoft doesn't have flag emojis. Check to make sure your
      emojis convey what you're intending.
    </Box>
  </Box>
</Box>

- Make sure the emoji has enough contrast for both light and dark modes.
- Place them at the beginning or end of sentences, not in the middle.
- Use within text (as opposed to an image or any other format).

<Box css={{ position: "relative", paddingLeft: "$200" }}>
  <Box
    role="list"
    css={{
      // Space for custom marker
      "&::before": {
        content: '"○"', // Open circle as marker
        position: "absolute",
        left: "$100",
        fontSize: "$100", // Size of marker
        color: "$gray20", // Customize as needed (or set a color variable)
      },
    }}
  >
    <Box role="listItem">This is required by Apple's guidelines.</Box>{" "}
  </Box>
</Box>

- Make sure related copy stands on its own — emojis should be able to be deleted without affecting the meaning.

## When to avoid

**Avoid using emojis: **

- To represent our core product offerings.
  <Box css={{ position: "relative", paddingLeft: "$200" }}>
    <Box
      role="list"
      css={{
        // Space for custom marker
        "&::before": {
          content: '"○"', // Open circle as marker
          position: "absolute",
          left: "$100",
          fontSize: "$100", // Size of marker
          color: "$gray20", // Customize as needed (or set a color variable)
        },
      }}
    >
      <Box role="listItem">
        If we need art to represent core product offerings, we should evaluate if
        the use case warrants creating custom art.
      </Box>{" "}
    </Box>
  </Box>
- If there's any chance of the emojis appearing juxtaposed with grim, serious stories.
