## Color Contrast

Low color contrast can make text and other page elements harder to see for everyone, especially some users.

The Post's [accessibility statement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/accessibility/) notes that we are guided by the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA. However, we strongly encourage meeting AAA color contrast requirements.

<br />
## WebAim Color Contrast Checker

The [WebAim Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) evaluates colors for WCAG compliance. You enter the hex values for the foreground and background colors, and the site calculates the contrast ratio. It rates the colors with a “Pass” or “Fail” rating. You can use the slider under each color to lighten or darken it until a “Pass” rating is attained. The hex code will update accordingly.

## Color Blindness

There are many forms of color blindness, and they have different affects on perception of color.

When working with graphics and data visualizations, it is especially important to ensure users can easily distinguish between different elements.

<br />
## Tools

[David Nichols' coloring for colorblindness tool](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40) allows you to input a color palette and see how that palette appears to users with different forms of colorblindness.

You can inspect the resulting colors in your browser to collect their hex codes and independently verify they have [enough contrast with each other](/accessibility/guides/color-contrast).
