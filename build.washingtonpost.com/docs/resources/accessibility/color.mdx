## Color Contrast

Low color contrast can make text and other page elements harder to see for everyone, especially some users.

The Post's [accessibility statement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/accessibility/) notes that we are guided by the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA. However, we strongly encourage meeting AAA color contrast requirements.

### WebAIM Color Contrast Checker

The [WebAIM Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) evaluates colors for WCAG compliance. You enter the hex values for the foreground and background colors, and the site calculates the contrast ratio. It rates the colors with a “Pass” or “Fail” rating. You can use the slider under each color to lighten or darken it until a “Pass” rating is attained. The hex code will update accordingly.

      alt="Screenshot of the WebAIM Color Contrast Checker shows #AE726A — a shade of brown — selected as the foreground color, and #FFFFFF — pure white — selected as the background color. The contrast ratio is listed below as 3.87:1. Below that, examples of the color combo are shown for normal text, large text and graphical objects and user interface components, along with notes on whether the selected color combo passes WCAG AA and/or AAA standards in each scenario."

### Adobe Color Contrast Checker

The [Adobe Color Contrast Checker](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) has a different UI than the WebAIM tool, so try both to see which better fits your needs.

## Color Blindness

There are many forms of color blindness, and they have different affects on perception of color.

When working with graphics and data visualizations, it is especially important to ensure users can easily distinguish between different elements.

### David Nichols' coloring for colorblindness tool

The [coloring for colorblindness tool](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40) allows you to input a color palette and see how that palette appears to users with different forms of colorblindness.

You can inspect the resulting colors in your browser to collect their hex codes and independently verify they have [enough contrast with each other](/accessibility/guides/color-contrast).

<Container>
  <Box css={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", margin: "auto" }}>
    <InlineImage
      width={836}
      height={448}
      src="/images/coloring-for-colorblindness.png"
      alt="Screenshot of the coloring for colorblindness tool shows a color palette of red, light blue, mustard yellow and dark green squares stacked. Three stacks of squares to the right of it show the colors' different appearances to people with three forms of colorblindness: protanopia, deuteranopia and tritanopia."

### Adobe Color Blind Safe tool

The [Adobe Color Blind Safe tool](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-accessibility) has a different UI than David Nichols' tool, so try both to see which better fits your needs.

One advantage of the Adobe tool is that it has a built-in warning when colors are deemed to conflict for at at least one form of color blindness. Learn more on [Adobe's webpage about its tools](https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/adobe-color-accessibility-tools.html).

<Container>
  <Box css={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", margin: "auto" }}>
    <InlineImage
      width={836}
      height={448}
      src="/images/adobe-color-blind-safe.png"
      alt="Screenshot of the Adobe Color Blind Safe tool shows that two of the colors the user selected are in conflict for the color blindness known as Protanopia. The Adobe tool looks similar to the WebAIM one, but the palette is oriented sideways, and the colorblindness versions are stacked below it. There is also a color wheel with markers on it for each color in the palette."

## Dark mode considerations

### Light or dark, or both?

It is best practice to support both light and dark mode on all content. This includes conducting the contrast tests described above in both modes. All links, buttons, fonts, etc. on the page should be visible in both modes.

### Respecting browser settings

Many users will have dark mode configured in their browser and/or system settings. When possible, we should build responsively and default to light or dark mode based on user settings without them having to manually click a toggle on our page.

A good way to respond to user settings is [the prefers-color-scheme CSS media feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme), as documented by MDN.

### Avoid white text on black backgrounds

Never use white text on a pure black background (in any circumstance, but be especially weary of this in dark mode). This causes [a fuzziness effect known as halation](https://medium.com/@h_locke/why-dark-mode-causes-more-accessibility-issues-than-it-solves-d2f8359bb46a) for many readers with astigmatism, and it makes reading difficult.

You can use a dark gray background, instead of black, to avoid this issue.

### Avoid black text on white backgrounds

Never use pure black text on a white background (in any circumstance, but be especially weary of this in light mode). Pure black text on a white background is [known to cause eye strain among many users](https://uxmovement.com/content/why-you-should-never-use-pure-black-for-text-or-backgrounds/).

You can use dark gray text, instead of black, to avoid this issue.

## Never rely on color coding

Even if you have fully accounted for contrast, colorblindness and compatability with various user settings like dark mode, you should never rely purely on color coding to convey information to users.

Screen reader users will always need text explanations of content. Others have their devices set to grayscale, so colors are mostly indistinguishable. Furthermore, colors may also have different cultural meanings across users, leading to confusion over the selection of colors and what it all means.

Save yourself and your users the trouble by using text to convey the meaning of anything that you're tempted to convey via color.
