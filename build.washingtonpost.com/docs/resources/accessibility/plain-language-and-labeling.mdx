## The basics: Never make assumptions

You might think a big word or jargon or idiom is perfect to describe a situation. But these should be avoided. Not everyone will know what they mean.

The U.S. federal government has [detailed plain language guidelines](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/). 

They include the following:
- [Write for your audience](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/audience/)
- [Organize the information](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/organize/)
- [Choose your words carefully](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/words/)
- [Be concise](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/concise/)
- [Keep it conversational](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/conversational/)
- [Design for reading](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/design/)
- [Follow web standards](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/web/)
- [Test your assumptions](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/test/)

<br />
Additionally, the U.S. National Archives provide [principles for plain language](https://www.archives.gov/open/plain-writing/10-principles.html).

## Avoid emojis, when possible

Emojis often have confusing or unintended meanings, especially across generations and cultures. They are also annoying for blind and low-vision screen reader users. They should be avoided unless they are central to the content.

<br />
## Hashtags and CamelCase

CamelCase involves capitalizing the first letter of each word in a multiple-word hashtag. This allows screen readers to distinguish words in a hashtag and increases legibility for everyone.

**For example, use #TheWashingtonPost instead of #thewashingtonpost.**

Capitalize the letters in acronyms and initials as well. 

**For example, use #WPMedia instead of #Wpmedia.**

<br />
## Icons

Meaning of icons, buttons and other elements should be explicitly conveyed via text whenever possible. In all cases, interactive elements should have appropriate [aria-labels](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) for screen reader users.

<br />
## Forms

If the content includes a form, make sure that clear error messages are provided so that users know when and how to correct their input.

Similarly, avoid user prompts or notices that disappear automatically, as this creates a frustrating user experience when the user cannot access something they need in time.
