## Plain language standards

Writing in plain language makes our content more accessible to a wide variety of people, including those with cognitive disabilities, lower reading literacy and less background knowledge of the topic or concept being covered. This also matters in the design of user interfaces.

The U.S. federal government has [detailed plain language guidelines](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/) and [a checklist](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/resources/checklists/checklist/). These are based on the [Plain Writing Act of 2010](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/PLAW-111publ274).

While we are an independent media organization, a lot of the guidance is relevant to us.

<br />
**In our work, we are particularly concerned with the following:**

- be concise
- use short sentences and clear structure
- use familiar, commonly understood words
- define any uncommon words or concepts
- avoid jargon, idioms and metaphors
- avoid excessive words and punctuation
- use the simplest tense possible
- use lists and tables to simplify complex material

<br />
<br />
## Avoid emojis and symbols

Emojis and other symbols may have confusing or unintended meanings, especially across generations and cultures. They are also annoying for blind and low-vision screen reader users. They should be avoided unless they are central to the content.

<br />
<br />
## Hashtags and CamelCase

CamelCase involves capitalizing the first letter of each word in a multiple-word hashtag. This allows screen readers to distinguish words in a hashtag and increases legibility for everyone.

**For example, use #TheWashingtonPost instead of #thewashingtonpost.**

Capitalize the letters in acronyms and initials as well.

**For example, use #WPMedia instead of #Wpmedia.**

<br />
<br />
## Icons

Meaning of icons, buttons and other elements [should be labeled with visibile text](https://uxdesign.cc/label-your-icons-e2bd57366d37) whenever possible. In all cases, interactive elements should have appropriate [aria-labels](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) for screen reader users.

As mentioned above, avoid relying on emojis or symbols. If you do use them, make sure to include visible text descriptions as well.

<br />
<br />
## Forms

If the content includes a form, make sure that clear error messages are provided so that users know when and how to correct their input.

Similarly, avoid user prompts or notices that disappear automatically, as this creates a frustrating user experience when the user cannot access something they need in time.

WebAIM provides [guidance on accessible forms](https://webaim.org/techniques/forms/#:~:text=Accessible%20forms%20are%20easy%20to,must%20be%20intuitive%20and%20descriptive.).
