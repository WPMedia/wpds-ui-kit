## The basics

Text should be written in plain language wherever possible. Is there any jargon or use of idioms? These should be avoided.

Meaning of icons, buttons and other elements should be explicitly conveyed via text whenever possible. In all cases, interactive elements should have appropriate aria-labels for screen reader users.

Avoid user prompts or notices that disappear automatically, as this creates a frustrating user experience when the user cannot access something they need in time.

If the content includes a form, make sure that clear error messages are provided so that users know when and how to correct their input.
