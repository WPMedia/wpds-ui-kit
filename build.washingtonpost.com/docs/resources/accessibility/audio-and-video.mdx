## Avoid flashing content

Content that flashes can trigger seizures or other adverse effects for some users.

Nothing should flash on the screen more than 3 times within a single second. In general, flashing content should be avoided entirely.

<br />
## Avoid auto-play; and always provide option to pause, stop or hide

Are there any videos, gifs or animations on the page? They should have an accessible pause, stop or hide button.

Auto-playing video content in any situation is strongly discouraged.

Never auto-play audio.

<br />
## Captions and transcripts

Anywhere there is audio (including in videos), there should also be captions and a transcript provided. These should include words spoken AND any other meaningful sounds from the audio (such as a sigh or laugh in conversation, or the chopping of a knife in cooking) as well.

Don't rely on video to convey essential information. Video descriptions should be provided in text so that blind and low-vision users understand what the video shows.
