## Audio

### Auto-play

Never auto-play audio.

### Pause, stop or hide button

All audio should have an accessible [pause, stop or hide button](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html) so that users can turn the audio off as needed.

### Transcripts

See [our transcripts section](#Transcripts).

## Video (including gifs and animations)

### Avoid flashing content

Content that flashes can trigger seizures or other adverse effects for some users.

Nothing should flash on the screen more than 3 times within a single second. In general, flashing content should be avoided entirely.

### Avoid auto-play

Auto-playing video content in any situation is strongly discouraged.

### Pause, stop or hide button

All videos, gifs or animations should have an accessible [pause, stop or hide button](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html).

### Captions

Any time a video includes audio, there should also be captions provided. These should include words spoken AND any other meaningful sounds from the audio (such as a sigh or laugh in conversation, or the chopping of a knife in cooking) as well.

Closed captions are preferable so that users can turn them on or off per their preferences.

Ensure captions have appropriate color contrast with the video (rendering captions as white text on a dark gray background is common), and keep the captions in sentence case. Avoid kinetic captions, which are captions with "fun" effects like changing text size and location, which make them harder to read and thus less accessible.

### Transcripts

See [our transcripts section](#Transcriptions).

### Video descriptions

Don't rely on video alone to convey important information. Video descriptions should be provided in text so that blind and low-vision users understand what the video shows.

## Transcripts

Anytime there is audio or a video including audio, there should also a transcript provided. These should include words spoken AND any other meaningful sounds from the audio (such as a sigh or laugh in conversation, or the chopping of a knife in cooking) as well.

Transcripts should be prominently placed near the audio or video they transcribe. Don't hide transcripts behind other menus.

Timestamps are usually not necessary and can make transcripts uneccessarily cluttered.

Speaker names should be provided whenever there is more than one speaker in a video or audio.

**Always confirm transcript accuracy manually when using automated transcribers.**
