## Audio

### Auto-play

Never auto-play audio.

### Pause, stop or hide button

All audio should have an accessible [pause, stop or hide button](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html) so that users can turn the audio off as needed.

### Transcriptions

Anywhere there is audio, there should also be a transcript provided. These should include words spoken AND any other meaningful sounds from the audio (such as a sigh or laugh in conversation, or the chopping of a knife in cooking) as well.

Timestamps are usually not necessary and can make transcripts uneccessarily cluttered.

## Video (including gifs and animations)

### Avoid flashing content

Content that flashes can trigger seizures or other adverse effects for some users.

Nothing should flash on the screen more than 3 times within a single second. In general, flashing content should be avoided entirely.

### Avoid auto-play

Auto-playing video content in any situation is strongly discouraged.

### Pause, stop or hide button

All videos, gifs or animations should have an accessible [pause, stop or hide button](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html).

### Captions and transcripts

Any time a video includes audio, there should also be captions and a transcript provided. These should include words spoken AND any other meaningful sounds from the audio (such as a sigh or laugh in conversation, or the chopping of a knife in cooking) as well.

Ensure captions have appropriate color contrast with the video (rendering captions as white text on a dark gray background is common), and keep the captions in sentence case. Avoid kinetic captions, which are captions with "fun" effects like changing text size and location, which make them harder to read and thus less accessible.

Don't rely on video to convey essential information. Video descriptions should be provided in text so that blind and low-vision users understand what the video shows.
