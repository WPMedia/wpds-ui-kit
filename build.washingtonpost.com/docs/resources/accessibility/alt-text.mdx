Alt text is also commonly called alternative text or an image description. This is the text that is read aloud to users of assistive technology known as a [screen reader](/resources/accessibility/screen-readers.mdx). These users are often people who are blind or have low vision. Alt text may also be shown in place of an image that is unable to load.

<br />
## Syntax (img vs. svg)

### For img tags

Alt text is supplied via the `alt` attribute on img tags. An example of this is `<img alt="alt text goes here" src="example.png" />`.

Every img tag should have the `alt` attribute. Failure to explicitly set this value may lead to the image file name being read out loud to screen reader users, which is often an unhelpful nuisance. If we explicitly set `alt=""`, then the image will be skipped by screen readers. Thus, if an image is purely decorative, then you should have something like `<img alt="" src="purely-decorative.png" />`.

**Note:** If your img tag's `src` is the path to an SVG, then you should add `role="img"` to the img tag. It may seem redundant, but this helps screen readers treat the SVG correctly when reading alt text. So we should have `<img alt="alt text goes here" src="example.svg" role="img" />`.

### For svg tags

svg tags do not have the `alt` attribute, but we can still provide alt text for SVGs.

We recommend using whichever of the following two methods is most appropriate for your use case.

#### Method 1: Set aria-hidden="true" on svg and add alt text elsewhere

For our [WPDS Icon component](/components/icon#Options), we use the following steps:

1. Add `aria-hidden="true"` to the svg tag so that it is [skipped by screen readers](/resources/accessibility/semantic-html#Hiding%20content%20from%20screen%20readers).
2. Add a span next to the svg (as an immediate sibiling element) and apply [the sr-only class or Visually Hidden wrapper](http://localhost:3000/resources/accessibility/semantic-html#Content%20for%20screen%20readers%20only) so the span is readable only by screen readers.
3. Add the alt text for the svg into the newly added span element. Since the alt text is not in an img element, screen readers will not be told
that the text is describing an image unless you explicitly mention that in the text.

<br />
Below is an example of how this works. Inspect the icon with the Chrome developer tools to view the HTML and CSS. Or, better yet, [test it out with the screen reader](/resources/accessibility/screen-readers) of your choice.

```jsx withPreview
export default function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <Icon label="Warning icon" size="200" fill={theme.colors.primary}>
        <Warning />
      </Icon>
    </>
  );
}
```

<br />

**Note:** We used a `span` in the example above, but you may find another element type, such as a `table`, is better suited to describe certain svg contents. In the past, The Post has used [an sr-only table as an alternative to a map svg](https://washpost.engineering/accessibility-case-study-pairing-election-data-visualizations-with-tables-6bd5db221a1c?source=collection_home---4------7-----------------------) to share county-level election results with screen reader users.

There is another method for providing SVG alt text that is often better for graphics and other visuals.

#### Method 2: Use aria-labelledby with title tag and aria-describedby with desc tag

1. Add a [title tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/title) **as the first child of the svg tag** (as shown in the example below) to provide a short name for the image. The title may also be viewable to sighted users who hover over the svg with a mouse.
2. If the image cannot be described with a brief (approxiately one sentence) title, then add a [desc tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/desc) below the title tag to provide more details. As an example, the desc for an SVG graphic may list out specific details from the graphic whereas the title briefly summarizes the graphic's appearance. Individual [rects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/rect), [circles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/circle) and other visual elements within an svg tag can have their own descs, but we recommend just one root-level desc as alt text.
3. Give the title and desc tags unique [id attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) values. Then, in the svg tag, set `aria-labelledby="id of title tag goes here"` and `aria-describedby="id of desc tag goes here"`.
4. Since we do not apply `aria-hidden="true"` to the svg tag in this method, we must apply `aria-hidden="true"` to each [text tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/text) within the svg. Otherwise the title and desc tags may not be read correctly. Note that the "visible text" element in the example below is not read by a screen reader but is mentioned as part of the alt text in the desc tag.

<br />
Select "Show code" below to view our implementation. This is a model you can follow for your own SVGs.

```jsx withPreview
export default function Example() {
  return (
    <svg
      viewBox="0 0 100 100"
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
      fill-rule="evenodd"
      clip-rule="evenodd"
      stroke-linecap="round"
      stroke-linejoin="round"
      stroke-miterlimit="1.5"
      style={{ maxWidth: "90px" }}
      aria-labelledby="heart-title"
      aria-describedby="heart-description"
    >
      <title id="heart-title">Heart shape</title>
      <desc id="heart-description">
        Not an actual heart, but a red heart-shaped polygon with the words
        "example text" placed in small black text in the top right corner
      </desc>
      <path
        d="M50 22.7703c-9.428-17.171-28.284-17.171-37.712-8.585-9.429 8.585-9.429 25.756 0 42.927 6.6 12.878 23.57 25.757 37.712 34.342 14.143-8.585 31.113-21.464 37.713-34.342 9.428-17.171 9.428-34.342 0-42.927-9.428-8.586-28.285-8.586-37.713 8.585z"
        fill="#dc0000"
        stroke="#dc0000"
      ></path>
      <text aria-hidden="true" x="20" y="35">
        Visible text
      </text>
    </svg>
  );
}
```

[a11y-101.com](https://a11y-101.com/development/svg) demonstrates other ways to label the heart svg above, including their shortcomings. Carie Fisher, a Senior Accessibility Consultant and Trainer at Deque Systems, also performed [a study comparing different alt text placements for SVGs](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/05/accessible-svg-patterns-comparison/).

In summary, there is not a perfect solution to alt text for SVGs, but we recommend the methods above.

## Alt text fallbacks

Do not use something like "Image" or "Image without alt text" as fallback alt text when a value is not provided. This text is useless to screen reader users.

Use `alt=""` as the fallback anywhere an unknown image may be missing alt text (e.g. old content with many non-essential images is being ported to a new platform).

If an image is important to understanding the content, then a non-empty alt text value should be required. Fallbacks should never be used.

We have an engineering blog post with [more context on fallbacks for alt text](https://washpost.engineering/we-cant-automate-alt-text-here-are-some-mistakes-lessons-and-what-we-can-do-for-accessibility-4e8631c2b3).

## Captions vs. alt text

Alt text is NOT the same as a caption.

A caption is generally adding context to an image, whereas alt text is describing what the image contains for those who can’t see it.

Consider The Post's caption for the below image: "This image released by NASA on July 12 was captured by the James Webb Space Telescope. (AP)"

<Container>
  <Box css={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", margin: "auto" }}>
    <InlineImage
      width={672}
      height={448}
      src="/images/caption-example.png"
      alt="Screenshot shows a Washington Post article zoomed in on just an image and caption. The caption says, 'This image released by NASA on July 12 was captured by the James Webb Space Telescope. (AP)' NASA's alt text for the image is below."
    />
  </Box>
</Container>
<br />

The caption is effective. It adds useful context for readers: when the image was released, who released it and how it was taken. The caption also credits AP (The Associated Press) for providing the image.

<br />
**NASA wrote the following alt text for the image above:**

"The image is divided horizontally by an undulating line between a cloudscape forming a nebula along the bottom portion and a comparatively clear upper portion. Speckled across both portions is a starfield, showing innumerable stars of many sizes. The smallest of these are small, distant, and faint points of light. The largest of these appear larger, closer, brighter, and more fully resolved with 8-point diffraction spikes. The upper portion of the image is blueish, and has wispy translucent cloud-like streaks rising from the nebula below. The orangish cloudy formation in the bottom half varies in density and ranges from translucent to opaque. The stars vary in color, the majority of which have a blue or orange hue. The cloud-like structure of the nebula contains ridges, peaks, and valleys — an appearance very similar to a mountain range. Three long diffraction spikes from the top right edge of the image suggest the presence of a large star just out of view."

<br />
**Most images should not have alt text as long or complex as the example above. However,
this example shows the purpose of alt text.**

When we use visuals in our work, it is our job to convey the meaning of the visuals in text for blind and low-vision users. In this case, NASA wanted to capture the detail of the image because that was its relevance to the story being told: the power of the new telescope and the level of detail it unlocked.

Below is guidance on how to approach alt text in different scenarios that are common in media.

## Alt text for images of text

All of the text from an image you want your users to see should also be included in the alt text for that image so blind and low-vision users can hear it.

For instance, an image of a headline should have the headline also added in the alt text field. You may add additional context, such as "Screenshot of a Washington Post headline that says, 'Eagles lose Super Bowl 38-35'" where "Eagles lose Super Bowl 38-35" is the exact headline from the screenshot.

Below is an example from The Washington Post Twitter account.

<Container>
  <Box css={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", margin: "auto" }}>
    <InlineImage
      width={672}
      height={448}
      src="/images/text-alt-text.png"
      alt="Screenshot shows a Washington Post tweet from October 26, 2021. The tweet says, 'Haugen has made headlines for her decision to blow the whistle on Facebook, testifying in front of Congress, appearing on 60 Minutes and on the cover of Time Magazine. Her revelations have created a firestorm. Here's what you need to know:.' The tweet includes two images. The alt text has been expanded for sighted users on one of the images and says, 'FAQ: Who is Frances Haugen? How did Haugen take the documents? Why would she want to take the documents in the first place? Why did Facebook allow such easy access to its document? What about Google?' The images contains that same text in bulleted format with a blue label reading 'Facebook under fire.'"

## Alt text for data visualizations

Data visualization alt text should focus on the visualization type, the type of data shown and the reason for including the visualization.

Read [more detailed guidance on alt text for data visualizations](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81) from Amy Ceval, co-founder of the Data Visualization Society.

Below is an example from The Washington Post Twitter account.

<Container>
  <Box css={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", margin: "auto" }}>
    <InlineImage
      width={672}
      height={448}
      src="/images/data-viz-alt-text.png"
      alt="Screenshot shows a Washington Post tweet. The tweet says, 'In between Republicans who remain firmly committed or opposed to the former president, there’s now a broad range of Trump supporters who, however much they still like him, aren’t sure they want him as the party’s next nominee.' The tweet includes an image. Its alt text has been expanded for sighted users and says, 'Line graph showing that Trump's favorability among Republicans has fallen from around 90 percent to around 75 percent since 2020.'"

## Alt text for other images

1. Describe the type of image, if relevant. Don't use generic phrases like "Picture of" or "Image of" because screen reader users already know when they are hearing alt text for an image. If the image has a specific type (illustration, graphic, headshot, etc.), then it is probably relevant to note that, as done in the example below.
2. Be concise. Alt text doesn't need to describe every tiny detail in an image, just the relevant parts for the overall meaning. Typical alt text is no more than a few sentences. If the image is complex, this may be longer, but try to keep it as short as possible while including all necesary details.
3. Never assume race, gender, etc. If known, use these and other identifiers when relevant to the image or context in which the image is used. Note that the subject of the image may have their own preferences on how they are identified for the purposes of a story or other content.
4. Avoid including your opinion on the image. Alt text should be an objective description. Words like "pretty" or "scary" are generally not useful.
5. Write in plain language so that the alt text's meaning is clear. Avoid complicated words and sentence structures. Avoid jargon and idioms. We have [more guidance on plain language](/accessibility/guides/plain-language-and-labeling).

<br />
Below is an example from The Washington Post Twitter account.

<Container>
  <Box css={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", margin: "auto" }}>
    <InlineImage
      width={672}
      height={448}
      src="/images/graphic-alt-text.png"
      alt="Screenshot shows a Washington Post tweet. The tweet says, Here's a look at some of the cards that you can share for Valentine's Day:. The alt text from one of the card images has been expanded for sighted users and says, Valentine's Day card with illustration of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and text that reads, Florida's red, Vermont is blue, I'd wait 15 rounds of voting for you."

## SEO considerations

**SEO is not the purpose of alt text.** We write our alt text to make content more accessible to real users.

[Google warns us not to stuff keywords into alt text](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/google-images#descriptive-alt-text): "Avoid filling alt attributes with keywords (also known as [keyword stuffing](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#keyword-stuffing)) as it results in a negative user experience and may cause your site to be seen as spam." So, **trying to abuse the alt text field for SEO can actually end up hurting your SEO.**

Consider the potential SEO benefits of alt text to be a positive side effect of making our content more accessible.

## Punctuation, emojis and other symbols

### Punctuation

Listen to your alt text using a screen reader to understand how punctuation affects the way it is read aloud.

Deque provides [a guide to special characters for screen readers](https://www.deque.com/blog/dont-screen-readers-read-whats-screen-part-1-punctuation-typographic-symbols/), which gives context on how some punctuation is read by screen readers.

**But online guides are not a substitute for manual testing. Guides become outdated quickly as screen readers evolve and change.**

### Emojis, emoticons and other symbols

Alt text is for people who cannot see the image. Emojis and symbols often have confusing or unintended text when read by a screen reader, so they should be avoided entirely.

Similarly, avoid emoticons like :) in your alt text and elsewhere. Screen readers may not recognize them and may instead read them as punctuation.

---

## Don't use hyperlinks in alt text

Links are not clickable when used in alt text. A screen reader user may hear each character in the link read out one by one and will be unable to click the link anyway. Include links in the text surrounding the image instead of in the alt text, and make sure to follow [our hyperlink text guidelines](http://localhost:3000/resources/accessibility/semantic-html#Hyperlink%20text%20guidelines) for that.

Don't just take our word for it; try it yourself. Use a screen reader to listen to a hyperlink in alt text. You will probably hear something like "h-t-t-p-colon-slash-slash" and so on. It is a bad user experience.

---

## Hashtags and CamelCase

Social media hashtags are a form of hyperlink and thus won't be clickable in alt text.

If a hashtag is essential to the alt text because it is the name of a movement or effort, for instance, then it should be included in the alt text with CamelCase formatting. CamelCase involves capitalizing the first letter of each word in a multiple-word hashtag. This allows screen readers to distinguish words in a hashtag and increases legibility for everyone.

**For example, use #TheWashingtonPost instead of #thewashingtonpost.**

Capitalize the letters in acronyms and initials as well.

**For example, use #WPMedia instead of #Wpmedia.**
