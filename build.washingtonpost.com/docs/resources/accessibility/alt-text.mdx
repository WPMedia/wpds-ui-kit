## Syntax

Alt text is also commonly called alternative text or an image description. It is supplied with the `alt` property on `<img/>` tags.

Every `<img/>` tag should have the `alt` attribute. Failure to explicitly set this value may lead to the image file name being read out loud to screen reader users, which is often an unhelpful nuisance. If the alt value is set to "", then the image will be skipped by screen readers. Thus, if an image is purely decorative, then you should use alt="".

Using alt text like "Image without alt text" as a fallback is bad practice because this will cause a screen reader to read this unhelpful text aloud instead of just skipping the image entirely (as it would with alt text of ""). We have an engineering blog post with [more context on fallbacks for alt text](https://washpost.engineering/we-cant-automate-alt-text-here-are-some-mistakes-lessons-and-what-we-can-do-for-accessibility-4e8631c2b3).

## Captions vs. alt text

Alt text is NOT the same as a caption.

A caption is generally adding context to an image, whereas alt text is describing what the image contains for those who can’t see it.

For example, consider The Post's caption for the below image.

"This image released by NASA on July 12 was captured by the James Webb Space Telescope. (AP)"

<Container>
  <Box css={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", margin: "auto" }}>
    <InlineImage
      width={672}
      height={448}
      src="/images/caption-example.png"
      alt="Screenshot shows a Washington Post article zoomed in on just an image and caption. The caption says, 'This image released by NASA on July 12 was captured by the James Webb Space Telescope. (AP)' NASA's alt text for the image is below."
    />
  </Box>
</Container>
<br />

The caption is effective. It adds useful context for readers: when the image was released, who released it and how it was taken. The caption also credits AP (The Associated Press) for providing the image.

<br />
**NASA wrote the following alt text for the image above:**

"The image is divided horizontally by an undulating line between a cloudscape forming a nebula along the bottom portion and a comparatively clear upper portion. Speckled across both portions is a starfield, showing innumerable stars of many sizes. The smallest of these are small, distant, and faint points of light. The largest of these appear larger, closer, brighter, and more fully resolved with 8-point diffraction spikes. The upper portion of the image is blueish, and has wispy translucent cloud-like streaks rising from the nebula below. The orangish cloudy formation in the bottom half varies in density and ranges from translucent to opaque. The stars vary in color, the majority of which have a blue or orange hue. The cloud-like structure of the nebula contains ridges, peaks, and valleys — an appearance very similar to a mountain range. Three long diffraction spikes from the top right edge of the image suggest the presence of a large star just out of view."

<br />
**Most images should not have alt text as long or complex as the example above. However,
this example shows the purpose of alt text.**

When we use visuals in our work, it is our job to convey the meaning of the visuals in text for blind and low-vision users. In this case, NASA wanted to capture the detail of the image because that was its relevance to the story being told: the power of the new telescope and the level of detail it unlocked.

Below is guidance on how to approach alt text in different scenarios that are common in media.

## Alt text for images of text

All of the text from an image you want your users to see should also be included in the alt text for that image so blind and low-vision users can hear it.

For instance, an image of a headline should have the headline also added in the alt text field. You may add additional context, such as "Screenshot of a Washington Post headline that says, 'Eagles lose Super Bowl 38-35'" where "Eagles lose Super Bowl 38-35" is the exact headline from the screenshot.

Below is an example from The Washington Post Twitter account.

<Container>
  <Box css={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", margin: "auto" }}>
    <InlineImage
      width={672}
      height={448}
      src="/images/text-alt-text.png"
      alt="Screenshot shows a Washington Post tweet from October 26, 2021. The tweet says, 'Haugen has made headlines for her decision to blow the whistle on Facebook, testifying in front of Congress, appearing on 60 Minutes and on the cover of Time Magazine. Her revelations have created a firestorm. Here's what you need to know:.' The tweet includes two images. The alt text has been expanded for sighted users on one of the images and says, 'FAQ: Who is Frances Haugen? How did Haugen take the documents? Why would she want to take the documents in the first place? Why did Facebook allow such easy access to its document? What about Google?' The images contains that same text in bulleted format with a blue label reading 'Facebook under fire.'"

## Alt text for data visualizations

Data visualization alt text should focus on the visualization type, the type of data shown and the reason for including the visualization.

Read [more detailed guidance on alt text for data visualizations](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81) from Amy Ceval, co-founder of the Data Visualization Society.

Below is an example from The Washington Post Twitter account.

<Container>
  <Box css={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", margin: "auto" }}>
    <InlineImage
      width={672}
      height={448}
      src="/images/data-viz-alt-text.png"
      alt="Screenshot shows a Washington Post tweet. The tweet says, 'In between Republicans who remain firmly committed or opposed to the former president, there’s now a broad range of Trump supporters who, however much they still like him, aren’t sure they want him as the party’s next nominee.' The tweet includes an image. Its alt text has been expanded for sighted users and says, 'Line graph showing that Trump's favorability among Republicans has fallen from around 90 percent to around 75 percent since 2020.'"

## Alt text for other images

1. Describe the type of image, if relevant. Don't use generic phrases like "Photo of" or "Image of" because screen reader users already know when they are hearing alt text for an image. If the image has a specific type (illustration, graphic, headshot, etc.), then it is probably relevant to note that, as done in the example below.
2. Be concise. Alt text doesn't need to describe every tiny detail in an image, just the relevant parts for the overall meaning. Typical alt text is no more than a few sentences. If the image is complex, this may be longer, but try to keep it as short as possible while including all necesary details.
3. Never assume race, gender, etc. If known, use these and other identifiers when relevant to the image or context in which the image is used. Note that the subject of the image may have their own preferences on how they are identified for the purposes of a story or other content.
4. Avoid including your opinion on the image. Alt text should be an objective description. Words like "pretty" or "scary" are generally not useful.
5. Write in plain language so that the alt text's meaning is clear. Avoid complicated words and sentence structures. Avoid jargon and idioms. We have [more guidance on plain language](/accessibility/guides/plain-language-and-labeling).

<br />

  <Box css={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", margin: "auto" }}>
    <InlineImage
      width={672}
      height={448}
      src="/images/graphic-alt-text.png"
      alt="Screenshot shows a Washington Post tweet. The tweet says, Here's a look at some of the cards that you can share for Valentine's Day:. The alt text from one of the card images has been expanded for sighted users and says, Valentine's Day card with illustration of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and text that reads, Florida's red, Vermont is blue, I'd wait 15 rounds of voting for you."

## SEO considerations

SEO is not the purpose of alt text. We write our alt text to make content more accessible to real users.

[Google warns us not to stuff keywords into alt text](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/google-images#descriptive-alt-text): "Avoid filling alt attributes with keywords (also known as [keyword stuffing](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#keyword-stuffing)) as it results in a negative user experience and may cause your site to be seen as spam." So, trying to abuse the alt text field for SEO benefits can actually hurt SEO performance.

Consider the potential SEO benefits of alt text to be a positive externality of making our content more accessible.

## Punctuation, emojis and other symbols

### Punctuation

Listen to your alt text using a screen reader to understand how punctuation affects the way it is read aloud.

Deque provides [a guide to special characters for screen readers](https://www.deque.com/blog/dont-screen-readers-read-whats-screen-part-1-punctuation-typographic-symbols/), which gives context on how some punctuation is read by screen readers.

**But online guides are not a substitute for manual testing. Guides become outdated quickly as screen readers evolve and change.**

### Emojis, emoticons and other symbols

Alt text is for people who cannot see the image. Emojis and symbols often have confusing or unintended text when read by a screen reader, so they should be avoided entirely.

Similarly, avoid emoticons like :) in your alt text and elsewhere. Screen readers may not recognize them and may instead read them as punctuation.

## Don't use hyperlinks in alt text

Links are not clickable when used in alt text. A screen reader user may hear each character in the link read out one by one and will be unable to click the link anyway. Include links in the text surrounding the image instead of in the alt text, and make sure to follow [our hyperlink text guidelines](http://localhost:3000/resources/accessibility/semantic-html#Hyperlink%20text%20guidelines) for that.

Don't just take our word for it; try it yourself. Use a screen reader to listen to a hyperlink in alt text. You will probably hear something like "h-t-t-p-colon-slash-slash" and so on. It is a bad user experience.

---

## Hashtags and CamelCase

Social media hashtags are a form of hyperlink and thus won't be clickable in alt text.

If a hashtag is essential to the alt text because it is the name of a movement or effort, for instance, then it should be included in the alt text with CamelCase formatting. CamelCase involves capitalizing the first letter of each word in a multiple-word hashtag. This allows screen readers to distinguish words in a hashtag and increases legibility for everyone.

**For example, use #TheWashingtonPost instead of #thewashingtonpost.**

Capitalize the letters in acronyms and initials as well.

**For example, use #WPMedia instead of #Wpmedia.**
