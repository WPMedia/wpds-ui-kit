The following checklist is derived from the much more detailed [WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/). This does not cover every possible accessibility issue but aims to cover the most prominent varieties. It’s meant to be an entry-level guide. For help with any part of the guide, or to request an addition to any of our docs, contact accessibility@washpost.com. We can also share copies of this checklist as .md files upon request.

**Important: Repeat all steps below on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to better evaluate accessibility across devices.**

Thanks for incorporating accessibility considerations into your work!

<br />
## Automated testing

- **Run the axe DevTools tests**<br />
  You can install the [axe DevTools Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd?hl=en-US) and then use it on the page ([guide to using axe DevTools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRGB40c_YJc&t=36s)). Fix any issues that are flagged.

- **Run the WAVE tests**<br />
  You can install the [WAVE Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh?hl=en-US)
  and then use it on the page ([guide to using WAVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITUDiTgAZY0))
  to check for any other auto-detectable issues.

## Multimedia

- **Ensure all images have alt text**<br />
  Follow the [guidance for writing alt text](/resources/accessibility/alt-text).
  If an image is purely decorative, make sure it still has `alt` or `alt=""`
  present in the HTML. Similarly, videos and gifs should have text descriptions
  for screen reader users.

- **Hide certain content from screen readers**<br />
  Just as you would put alt="" for purely decorative images to hide them from
  screen readers, you should add [aria-hidden="true"](/resources/accessibility/semantic-html#Hiding%20content%20from%20screen%20readers)
  for content on the page that is not screen reader friendly. An example of this
  might be an election map full of svgs and labels, etc. Ideally, you’d include
  [a table version](/resources/accessibility/semantic-html#Tables) of the data
  for accessibility and just hide the map with aria-hidden.

- **Avoid auto-playing audio and video**<br />
  Never auto-play audio. Auto-playing video is strongly discouraged. Ensure all
  audio and video instances have an accessible [pause, stop or hide button](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html).

- **Eliminate rapidly flashing content**<br />
  Videos, gifs and animations must not include any instances of flashing or blinking
  more than 3 times within any one second, as this is a seizure risk.

- **Provide captions and transcripts**<br />
  Anywhere there is audio, there should be a [transcript](http://localhost:3000/resources/accessibility/audio-and-video#Transcripts) provided. Videos with audio should include [captions](</resources/accessibility/audio-and-video#Video%20(including%20gifs%20and%20animations)>) in addition to transcripts.
  Both should include words spoken AND any other meaningful sounds from the
  audio (such as a sigh or laugh in conversation, or the chopping of a knife
  in cooking) as well.

## Color

- **Confirm white text is never on a pure black background**<br />
  Pure white text on a pure black background causes a [fuzziness effect known
  as halation](https://medium.com/@h_locke/why-dark-mode-causes-more-accessibility-issues-than-it-solves-d2f8359bb46a)
  for many readers with astygmitism.

- **Confirm black text is never on a pure white background**<br />
  Pure black text on a pure white background is [known to cause eye strain among
  many users](https://uxmovement.com/content/why-you-should-never-use-pure-black-for-text-or-backgrounds/).

- **Ensure color contrast meets the WCAG AA standard**<br />
  All color combinations, especially for text and interactive elements, must
  meet at least the AA (preferably AAA) [color contrast](/resources/accessibility/color)
  standard [using the WebAIM tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

- **Check contrast for common forms of colorblindness**<br />
  Ensure color combinations meet the AA color contrast standard for [colorblind
  users](/resources/accessibility/color#Color%20Blindness) among at least the
  three most common forms of colorblindness.

- **View the page in dark and light mode**<br />
  [Dark mode and light mode](/resources/accessibility/color#Dark%20mode%20considerations)
  should both be supported. Does the page change to light or dark mode automatically
  per browser settings? Does the page pass color contrast thresholds in both
  modes? And does everything change color correctly upon toggling to light or
  dark? Are all links, buttons, fonts, etc. on the page still visible?

## Text, labels & zoom settings

- **Ensure text is readable and in plain language**<br />
  Text should be [no smaller than 12px](/resources/accessibility/text-size-and-zoom#Text%20size) and written in [plain language](/resources/accessibility/plain-language-and-labeling)
  wherever possible. Is there any jargon or use of idioms? These should be avoided.

- **Ensure non-English content is labeled as such**<br />
  Content in non-English languages, such as Arabic or Spanish, must have the
  lang="CODE" attribute set, where CODE is the language code e.g. “ar” for Arabic
  or “es” for Spanish. There’s a [list of language codes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp).
  This is essential for non-English text to be read correctly by screen readers.
  Additionally, Arabic and some other languages are read right-to-left. In those cases, we need to set an additional attribute in the HTML, `dir="rtl`.

- **Clearly label interactive content**<br />
  Meaning of icons, buttons and other elements should be explicitly conveyed
  via text whenever possible. In all cases, interactive elements should have
  appropriate aria-labels. See our [guidance on labeling for screen reader users](/resources/accessibility/semantic-html#Labeling%20interactive%20elements). Avoid user prompts or notices that disappear automatically. If the content
  includes a form, make sure that clear prompts and error messages are provided. See our
  [guidance on forms](/resources/accessibility/plain-language-and-labeling#Forms%20and%20user%20input).

- **Change page zoom level**<br />
  Set [page zoom](http://localhost:3000/resources/accessibility/text-size-and-zoom#Page%20zoom) to 200% (on a Mac, press `command +` to zoom in). Does text scale
  correctly? Is it still readable (no overflow, overlap, etc.)?

- **Change browser zoom level**<br />
  Restore page zoom to 100%, but [increase the font size in your browser settings](http://localhost:3000/resources/accessibility/text-size-and-zoom#Text%20size)
  to 200%. Does text scale correctly? Is it still readable?

## Screen reader & keyboard controls

- **Navigate content with keyboard only**<br />
  Using [your keyboard only](/accessibility/guides/keyboard-accessibility), `tab`
  through the buttons, links, hoverable elements and any others the user should
  be able to interact with, ensuring that (a) they each receive appropriate focus
  styles and (b) that they are clickable with the enter key (links and buttons)
  and/or space key (buttons). Each time you press the tab key, you should see
  something change on the page. If not, there is a missing focus style or tab
  index issue.

- **Confirm heading order is correct**<br />
  Check the heading order on the page using [inspect element in the Chrome dev
  tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/). Does the order make
  sense? There should be only one `h1`, the page title. From there, headings
  should be [ordered strictly by page heirarchy](/resources/accessibility/semantic-html#Heading%20order)
  (don't jump from `h2` to `h4`, don't use `h2` as a subhead of an `h3`, etc.).

- **Test with screen reader linearly**<br />
  Using [a screen reader](/accessibility/guides/screen-readers), navigate the
  page from top to bottom. Ensure all visible text is read aloud in a sensible
  order.

- **Test with screen reader rotor**<br />
  Using [a screen reader](/accessibility/guides/screen-readers), open the rotor
  and ensure all links, buttons and other elements have appropriate names. Interactive
  elements should not have generic names like "click here." You should be able
  to understand what the link or button does from the rotor menu without other
  context from the page.
