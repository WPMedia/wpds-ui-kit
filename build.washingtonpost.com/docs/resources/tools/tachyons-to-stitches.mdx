<br />
This utility converts Tachyon classes to a style object that can be used by Stitches
`styled` or `css` functions. Many colors are not an exact match between the two systems.
Tachonys colors are converted to the closest token value.

Theme tokens are referenced from the theme object that is imported from the `wpds-ui-kit` package.

```javascript
import { theme } from "@washingtonpost/wpds-ui-kit";
```

<StyleConverter />
