## Options

### Density: Default

By default, accordion items are styled with a padding value that is appropriate for most use-cases.

```jsx withPreview
export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Box
      css={{
        display: "flex",
        width: 500,
        rowGap: "$100",
        flexDirection: "column",
      }}
    >
      <Accordion.Root type={ACCORDION_TYPE.single} collapsible={true}>
        <Accordion.Item value={"item-1"}>
          <Accordion.Trigger>
            Here's some sample text for an accordion header item
          </Accordion.Trigger>
          <Accordion.Content>
            No! You don't even believe that! Gus has cameras everywhere, please.
            Listen to yourself! No, he has known everything, all along. Where
            were you today? In the lab? And you don't think it's possible that
            Tyrus lifted the cigarette out of your locker? Come on! Don't you
            see? You are the last piece of the puzzle. You are everything that
            he's wanted.
          </Accordion.Content>
        </Accordion.Item>
      </Accordion.Root>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

<BR />

### Density: Compact

"Compact" density applies a minimal amout of padding to the accordion item, producing a slimmer footprint that takes up less visual space.

```jsx withPreview
export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Box
      css={{
        display: "flex",
        width: 500,
        rowGap: "$100",
        flexDirection: "column",
      }}
    >
      <Accordion.Root type={ACCORDION_TYPE.single} collapsible={true}>
        <Accordion.Item value={"item-1"}>
          <Accordion.Trigger density={ACCORDION_DENSITY.compact}>
            Here's some sample text for an accordion header item
          </Accordion.Trigger>
          <Accordion.Content>
            No! You don't even believe that! Gus has cameras everywhere, please.
            Listen to yourself! No, he has known everything, all along. Where
            were you today? In the lab? And you don't think it's possible that
            Tyrus lifted the cigarette out of your locker? Come on! Don't you
            see? You are the last piece of the puzzle. You are everything that
            he's wanted.
          </Accordion.Content>
        </Accordion.Item>
      </Accordion.Root>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

### Density: Loose

"Loose" density applies a generous amount of padding to the accordion item, producing a larger footprint that occupies more visual space.

```jsx withPreview
export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Box
      css={{
        display: "flex",
        width: 500,
        rowGap: "$100",
        flexDirection: "column",
      }}
    >
      <Accordion.Root type={ACCORDION_TYPE.single} collapsible={true}>
        <Accordion.Item value={"item-1"}>
          <Accordion.Trigger density={ACCORDION_DENSITY.loose}>
            Here's some sample text for an accordion header item
          </Accordion.Trigger>
          <Accordion.Content>
            No! You don't even believe that! Gus has cameras everywhere, please.
            Listen to yourself! No, he has known everything, all along. Where
            were you today? In the lab? And you don't think it's possible that
            Tyrus lifted the cigarette out of your locker? Come on! Don't you
            see? You are the last piece of the puzzle. You are everything that
            he's wanted.
          </Accordion.Content>
        </Accordion.Item>
      </Accordion.Root>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

## Behavior

### Collapsed

Each accordion item consists of two main parts - the _header_, or item title and the _panel_, or item content. In the collapsed state, only the header is visible. When collapsed, the chevron icon also points _down_ to provide a visual signal for revealing additional information. By default, all items in the accordion are displayed in the collapsed state unless otherwise specified.

```jsx withPreview
export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Box css={{ width: 500 }}>
      <Accordion.Root type={ACCORDION_TYPE.single} collapsible={true}>
        <Accordion.Item value={"item-1"}>
          <Accordion.Trigger
            css={{
              fontWeight: theme.fontWeights.bold,
            }}
          >
            Header example text
          </Accordion.Trigger>
          <Accordion.Content>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Mauris in
            augue in felis pharetra finibus. In sagittis aliquam augue. Lorem
            ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
          </Accordion.Content>
        </Accordion.Item>
      </Accordion.Root>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

### Expanded

Users can access additional information by clicking or tapping the accordion item to reveal the expanded state. In the expanded state, the _panel_ is displayed directly below the _header_. The chevron icon points _up_ to indicate the current state and to provide a visual signal for returning the accordion item to its collapsed state.

```jsx withPreview
export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Box css={{ width: 500 }}>
      <Accordion.Root
        type={ACCORDION_TYPE.single}
        defaultValue="item-1"
        collapsible={true}
      >
        <Accordion.Item value="item-1">
          <Accordion.Trigger
            css={{
              fontWeight: theme.fontWeights.bold,
            }}
          >
            Header example text
          </Accordion.Trigger>
          <Accordion.Content>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Mauris in
            augue in felis pharetra finibus. In sagittis aliquam augue. Lorem
            ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
          </Accordion.Content>
        </Accordion.Item>
      </Accordion.Root>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

### Focus / Keyboard interaction

The accordion component is accessible via keyboard interaction. The "tab" key can be used to navigate items from top to bottom. The item currently in focus is denoted by a blue _outline_, using the CSS outline property. Pressing the "enter" ("return") key will expand or collapse the item in focus.

```jsx withPreview
export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Box css={{ width: 500 }}>
      <Accordion.Root
        type={ACCORDION_TYPE.single}
        defaultValue="item-1"
        collapsible={true}
      >
        <Accordion.Item value="item-1">
          <Accordion.Trigger forcefocus="true">
            Header text item one
          </Accordion.Trigger>
          <Accordion.Content>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Mauris in
            augue in felis pharetra finibus. In sagittis aliquam augue. Lorem
            ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
          </Accordion.Content>
        </Accordion.Item>
        <Accordion.Item value="item-2">
          <Accordion.Trigger>Header text item two</Accordion.Trigger>
          <Accordion.Content>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Mauris in
            augue in felis pharetra finibus. In sagittis aliquam augue. Lorem
            ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
          </Accordion.Content>
        </Accordion.Item>
      </Accordion.Root>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

### Disabled

The purpose of the accordion is to act as a container and visual interface for displaying static information upon user interaction. It is not intended to be used as an input element or form field. The accordion component does not require conditional logic to achieve its functionality and therefore _*does not feautre a special disabled state*_ or possess any manner of error-handling. If visual feedback for a disabled state is desired, consider using the [.not-allowed] CSS property.

```jsx withPreview
export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Box css={{ width: 500 }}>
      <Accordion.Root
        type={ACCORDION_TYPE.single}
        collapsible={true}
        disabled={true}
      >
        <Accordion.Item value="item-1">
          <Accordion.Trigger>Header example text</Accordion.Trigger>
          <Accordion.Content>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Mauris in
            augue in felis pharetra finibus. In sagittis aliquam augue. Lorem
            ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
          </Accordion.Content>
        </Accordion.Item>
      </Accordion.Root>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

## Guidance

### Font family overrides

By default, the accordion component uses "Franklin Light" as its primary font for both the _header_ and _panel_ - however, font family overrides are premitted depending on the use-case. Below, the header has been set in "Postoni".

```jsx withPreview isGuide="success"
export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Box css={{ width: 500 }}>
      <Accordion.Root type={ACCORDION_TYPE.single} collapsible={true}>
        <Accordion.Item value="item-1">
          <Accordion.Trigger
            css={{
              fontFamily: theme.fonts.headline,
              fontSize: theme.fontSizes[125],
              fontWeight: theme.fontWeights.bold,
            }}
          >
            Header example text
          </Accordion.Trigger>
          <Accordion.Content>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Mauris in
            augue in felis pharetra finibus. In sagittis aliquam augue. Lorem
            ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
          </Accordion.Content>
        </Accordion.Item>
      </Accordion.Root>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

### Font size overrides

The accordion component uses "size100" as its default font size. If a larger font size is desired, be mindful in choosing a size that is suitable for the use-case and appropriate for the space available. Avoid using font sizes that are excessively small or large, which may negatively affect your layout.

```jsx withPreview isGuide="warning"
export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Box
      css={{
        display: "flex",
        width: "100%",
        rowGap: "$100",
        flexDirection: "column",
        marginTop: "50px",
      }}
    >
      <Accordion.Root type={ACCORDION_TYPE.single} collapsible={true}>
        <Accordion.Item value="item-1">
          <Accordion.Trigger css={{ fontSize: theme.fontSizes["075"] }}>
            This header is too small
          </Accordion.Trigger>
          <Accordion.Content>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Mauris in
            augue in felis pharetra finibus. In sagittis aliquam augue. Lorem
            ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
          </Accordion.Content>
        </Accordion.Item>
      </Accordion.Root>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

```jsx withPreview isGuide="warning"
export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Box
      css={{
        display: "flex",
        width: "100%",
        rowGap: "$100",
        flexDirection: "column",
        marginTop: "50px",
      }}
    >
      <Accordion.Root type={ACCORDION_TYPE.single} collapsible={true}>
        <Accordion.Item value="item-1">
          <Accordion.Trigger
            css={{
              fontSize: theme.fontSizes[500],
              fontFamily: theme.fonts.headline,
            }}
          >
            This header is too large
          </Accordion.Trigger>
          <Accordion.Content>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Mauris in
            augue in felis pharetra finibus. In sagittis aliquam augue. Lorem
            ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
          </Accordion.Content>
        </Accordion.Item>
      </Accordion.Root>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

### Don't split or truncate content

The header of the accordion should be a complete sentence or statement. It _should not_ start in the header and continue in the panel.

```jsx withPreview isGuide="error"
export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Box css={{ width: 500 }}>
      <Accordion.Root type={ACCORDION_TYPE.single} collapsible={true}>
        <Accordion.Item value="item-1">
          <Accordion.Trigger>The rest of the sentence is...</Accordion.Trigger>
          <Accordion.Content>inside of the content.</Accordion.Content>
        </Accordion.Item>
      </Accordion.Root>
    </Box>
  );
}
```
