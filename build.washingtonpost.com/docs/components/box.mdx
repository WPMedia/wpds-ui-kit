## Options

### `as`

The `as` prop allows you to change the underlying HTML element that is rendered. This is useful for when you want to use a component that is not a `div` by default. Do not use this `as` to replace our Button component. Use the Button component for buttons.

```jsx withPreview
<Box as="span">I am a span</Box>
```

### `css`

The `css` props allows you to pass in a style object that will be applied to the underlying HTML element.

```jsx withPreview
<Box css={{ padding: "$100" }}>I am a regular ol' box.</Box>
```

## Guidance

### Protoyping

This component is used to create a box element with a set of default styles. It's best used in protoyping and playing with components. For production code, we recommend using "styled" or "css" functions intead. Prototyping is a great way to get started with a new project. It's a great way to get a feel for the components you'll need and how they'll work together. It's also a great way to get a feel for the design system you'll be using.

```jsx withPreview isGuide="success"
<Box css={{ padding: "$100" }}>I am a regular ol' box.</Box>
```

### Production

For production code, we recommend using "styled" or "css" functions intead. Production code is code that is ready to be shipped to production. It's code that we can be confident will work as expected like having built in best practices like accessibility and performance.

```jsx withPreview isGuide="error"
<Box css={{ padding: "$100" }}>I am a regular ol' box.</Box>
```

## Accessibility

This component is not accessible by default. You should always use the `as` prop to change the underlying HTML element to something more semantic.

```jsx withPreview isGuide="error"
<Box as="span">I am a span</Box>
```
