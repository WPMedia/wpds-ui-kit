## Options

### Positioning

The tooltip can be positioned top, left, right, and bottom with each having ability to position at the start, or end of the content container.

<AlertBanner.Root css={{ marginBottom: "$200" }} variant="information">
  <AlertBanner.Content>
    <b>Note:{` `}</b>This option sets the preferred position of the tooltip to
    render against when open. Will be reveresed when collisions occur with other
    elements.
  </AlertBanner.Content>
</AlertBanner.Root>

```jsx withPreview
export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Box css={{ maxWidth: 400 }}>
      <Tooltip.Provider>
        <Tooltip.Root defaultOpen={true}>
          <Tooltip.Trigger>
            <span>This is a tooltip trigger</span>
          </Tooltip.Trigger>
          <Tooltip.Content side="bottom">
            i want lots of things to go here and for this to get super super
            long and for this to never stop and i want more fries and i want it
            to rain but i also want the sun and i wasnt a vacataions and it
            doesn't matter if this is misspelled or whatverer.
          </Tooltip.Content>
        </Tooltip.Root>
      </Tooltip.Provider>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

### Density

There are two options for the property density: compact and default.

### Offset

The option offset can use any spacing token to offset its position from the origin point of the tooltip. The defualt offset is the spacing token 025.

## Behavior

### Avoids collisions

When appropriate, helper text should be placed closest to the Legend.

## Guidance

### Do not hide content

A tooltip is not meant to hide necessary contextual information. It should only be used as a supplementary element. The nautre of a tooltip is non-persistent and should not require users to discover content within a tooltip.

<GuideContainer variant="error">

</GuideContainer>

### Avoid nesting actionable elements

The nautre of the tooltip is non-persistent. When the user is required to take an action on an element nested inside the tooltip it makes the action less accessible for those with limited mobility.

<GuideContainer variant="warning">

</GuideContainer>

### Do not nest Popovers or Tooltips

Tooltips should not have additional tooltips or popover within the same container.

<GuideContainer variant="warning">

</GuideContainer>

---

## Accessibility

### Design considerations

While tooltips are a convenient way of revealing content, please keep in mind the nautre of a tooltip and how it shows/hides on hover. consider alternatives like a more persistent element like a popover.

### Keyboard controls

Tooltips will show/hide without delay when the trigger is in focus and _tab_ is selected on the keyboard. If the tooltip is open and either _escape, space,_ or _enter_ is selected on the keyboard, it will close the tooltip.
