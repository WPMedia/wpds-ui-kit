## Options

### Portal

Determine whether the result container should be rendered as poart of the search component and occupy space, or act more like a popover with a positional relationship.

```jsx withPreview

```

### Grouping

The search component supports a default group label that includes an optional icon. This feature can be utilized to help organize content and support multiple result groups. By default, the component returns results as a single list of items. The order in which they are returned depends on how the data is sorted prior to being passed.

```jsx withPreview

```

### Open on focus

Setting 'open on focus' to false will prevent the result container from appearing when there is no value in the input.

```jsx withPreview

```

## Behavior

### Autocomplete

Determines if the value is the input changes or not as the user navigates with the keyboard. If true, the value changes. If false, the value doesn't change.

```jsx withPreview

```

### Disabled

```jsx withPreview

```

### Selected

When a user has made a selection, the results container will collapse when the portal is set to false or disappear when the portal is set to true.

```jsx withPreview

```

### Overflow

The results container has a default max-height of 300px and when there are more results it will overflow with a default scrollbar.

```jsx withPreview

```

### Input with value

When the input has a text value, a clear button will appear to allow the user to easily clear the input value and set it to an empty value.

```jsx withPreview

```

### Loading results

```jsx withPreview

```

### Empty: No Results

```jsx withPreview

```

```jsx withPreview

```

## Guidance

### Results can be more than text

Results can be more than just a list of text. Depending on how you handle matching results, there could be space for recirculation, a different hierarchy in how results are displayed, and a more intuitive and visual discovery process.

```jsx withPreview isGuide="error"

```

### When to use icons

Results can be overwhelming depending on the query. To differentiate between different types of results, use icons to help users wayfind and scan the results.

```jsx withPreview isGuide="error"

```

### Helpful filtering

Helpful filtering can help folks get to their results faster without having to type in the correct keywords. Some ideas can include inputs like swithces, and tabs.

```jsx withPreview isGuide="error"

```

### Mobile best practices

There might be instances where a dedicated search view might be more appropriate. Utilizing the pattern of our drawer can be an effective way to do this.

```jsx withPreview isGuide="error"

```

## Accessibility

### Color contrast

All colors in the default combobox have been reviewed to ensure they meet the AA WCAG contrast requirement of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.

### Keyboard controls

Users can navigate search results using arrow keys on their keyboard and select a result by pressing the return key. This feature streamlines the search experience, reduces search time, and improves accessibility.
