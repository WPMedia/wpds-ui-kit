## Intro

Checklists are an essential part of accessibility testing, if done right. Review each item on the list for any new product or content.

Items are listed in order of estimated time to complete. The items toward the end should NOT be avoided. This ordering is meant to help us identify issues quickly. It is not a priority order. Check everything.

**Important: Repeat all steps below on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to ensure accessibility across devices.**

## The checklist

<form action="/action_page.php">
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1" name="vehicle1" value="Bike"/>
  <label for="vehicle1"> Run the [axe DevTools automated test](/accessibility/guides/automated-testing) on the page. Fix any issues that are flagged.</label><br/><br/>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1" name="vehicle1" value="Bike"/>
  <label for="vehicle1"> Are there any videos/gifs/animations on the page? They must (a) not include any instances of flashing or blinking more than 3 times within any one second (this is a seizure risk), and they should (b) have an accessible [pause, stop or hide button](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html). Auto-playing media of all forms is strongly discouraged.</label><br/><br/>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1" name="vehicle1" value="Bike"/>
  <label for="vehicle1"> Never auto-play audio. Anywhere there is audio, there should also be captions and a transcript provided. These should include words spoken AND any other meaningful sounds from the audio (such as a sigh or laugh in conversation, or the chopping of a knife in cooking) as well.</label><br/><br/>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle3" name="vehicle3" value="Boat"/>
  <label for="vehicle3"> Text should be written in [plain language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/resources/checklists/checklist/) wherever possible. Is there any jargon or use of idioms? These should be avoided.</label><br/><br/>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle3" name="vehicle3" value="Boat"/>
  <label for="vehicle3"> Meaning of icons, buttons and other elements should be explicitly conveyed via text whenever possible. In all cases, interactive elements should have appropriate `aria-labels` for screen reader users.</label><br/><br/>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle2" name="vehicle2" value="Car"/>
  <label for="vehicle2"> Ensure all images have alt text. If an image is purely decorative, make sure it still has `alt` or `alt=""` present in the HTML. Similarly, videos and gifs should have text descriptions for screen reader users.</label><br/><br/>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle2" name="vehicle2" value="Car"/>
  <label for="vehicle2"> Avoid user prompts or notices that disappear automatically. If the content includes a form, make sure that clear error messages are provided.</label><br/><br/>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle3" name="vehicle3" value="Boat"/>
  <label for="vehicle3"> Set page zoom to 200% (on a Mac, press `command +` to zoom in). Does text scale correctly? Is it still readable (no overflow, overlap, etc.)?</label><br/><br/>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle3" name="vehicle3" value="Boat"/>
  <label for="vehicle3"> Restore page zoom to 100%, but increase the font size in your browser settings to 200%. Does the text scale correctly on our page? Is it still readable?</label><br/><br/>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle3" name="vehicle3" value="Boat"/>
  <label for="vehicle3"> Using [your keyboard only](/accessibility/guides/keyboard-accessibility), `tab` through the buttons, links, hoverable elements and any others the user should be able to interact with, ensuring that (a) they each receive appropriate focus styles and (b) that they are clickable with the enter key (links and buttons) and/or space key (buttons). Each time you press the tab key, you should see something change on the page. If not, there is a missing focus style or tab index issue.</label><br/><br/>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle3" name="vehicle3" value="Boat"/>
  <label for="vehicle3"> Check the heading order on the page using [inspect element in the Chrome dev tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/). Does the order make sense? There should be only one `h1`, the page title. From there, headings should be ordered strictly by page heirarchy (don't jump from `h2` to `h4`, don't use `h2` as a subhead of an `h3`, etc.).</label><br/><br/>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle3" name="vehicle3" value="Boat"/>
  <label for="vehicle3"> Using [a screen reader](/accessibility/guides/screen-readers), navigate the page from top to bottom. Ensure all visible text is read aloud in a sensible order</label><br/><br/>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle3" name="vehicle3" value="Boat"/>
  <label for="vehicle3"> Using [a screen reader](/accessibility/guides/screen-readers), open the rotor and ensure all links, buttons and other elements have appropriate names. Interactive elements should not have generic names like "click here." You should be able to understand what the link or button does from the rotor menu without other context from the page.</label><br/><br/>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle3" name="vehicle3" value="Boat"/>
  <label for="vehicle3"> Confirm white text is never on a black background. This causes a [fuzziness effect known as halation](https://jessicaotis.com/academia/never-use-white-text-on-a-black-background-astygmatism-and-conference-slides/) for many readers with astygmitism.</label><br/><br/>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle3" name="vehicle3" value="Boat"/>
  <label for="vehicle3"> Ensure all color combos, especially text and interactive elements, meet at least AA (preferably AAA) [color contrast](/accessibility/guides/color-contrast) standard [using the WebAIM tool](/accessibility/guides/color-contrast).</label><br/><br/>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle3" name="vehicle3" value="Boat"/>
  <label for="vehicle3"> Ensure the color combinations meet the color contrast threshhold for [colorblind users](/accessibility/guides/color-blindness), as covered by [David Nichols' palette checker](/accessibility/guides/color-blindness).</label><br/><br/>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle3" name="vehicle3" value="Boat"/>
  <label for="vehicle3"> View the page in dark mode and light mode, if possible. (If not possible, that itself is an accessibility issue to report.) Does the page change to light or dark mode automatically per browser settings? Does the page pass color contrast thresholds in both modes? And does everything change color correctly upon toggling to light or dark? Are all links, buttons, fonts, etc. on the page still visible?</label><br/><br/>
