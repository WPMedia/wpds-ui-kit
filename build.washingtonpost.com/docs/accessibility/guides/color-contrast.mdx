## Why it's important

Low color contrast can make text and other page elements harder to see for everyone, especially some users.

The Post's [accessibility statement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/accessibility/) notes that we are guided by the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA. However, we strongly encourage meeting AAA color contrast requirements.

## WebAim Color Contrast Checker

The [WebAim Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) evaluates colors for WCAG compliance. You enter the hex values for the foreground and background colors, and the site calculates the contrast ratio. It rates the colors with a “Pass” or “Fail” rating.  You can use the slider under each color to lighten or darken it until a “Pass” rating is attained. The hex code will update accordingly.
