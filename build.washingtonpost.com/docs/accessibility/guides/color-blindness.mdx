## Why it's important

There are many forms of color blindness, and they have different affects on perception of color.

When working with graphics and data visualizations, it is especially important to ensure users can easily distinguish between different elements.

## Tools

[David Nichols' coloring for colorblindness tool](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40) allows you to input a color palette and see how that palette appears to users with different forms of colorblindness.

You can inspect the resulting colors in your browser to collect their hex codes and independently verify they have [enough contrast with each other](/accessibility/guides/color-contrast).
