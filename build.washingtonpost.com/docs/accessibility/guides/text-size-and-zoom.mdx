## How to ensure zoom compatability

Content on our pages should remain readable when a user increases their font size or enlarges text using zoom.

WCAG sets 200% as the minimum zoom level below which all content on a page should remain readable.

Zoom in using `Command +` (Mac) or `Control +` (Windows). You should be able to see the current zoom level momentarily, as shown below.

You'll want to watch for issues like overlapping text, text spilling out of containers, etc. that hinder readability as zoom level increases.

To fix such issues, ensure you are building components that resize dynamically. The below screenshot is from our homepage. We can see that it resizes into a one-column format to accomodate the high zoom level of 200%.

<Container>
  <Box css={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", margin: "auto" }}>
    <InlineImage width={836} height={448} src="/images/zoom-example.png" />
  </Box>
</Container>
