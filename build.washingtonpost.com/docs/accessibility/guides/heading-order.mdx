## Why it's important

Someone who is using a screen reader may jump around the headings on a page to quickly access content. If headings are used our of order, such as an h2 being placed below an h3 despite being a subtopic, then the user may be confused.

Skipping heading levels entirely, such as going from an h2 to an h4, can cause similar issues.

It may be tempting to use headings out of order based on their styles, but this should not be done. You can add a `className` to a heading to provide extra styles, or rework your heading styles entirely because they probably don't make sense in the first place if you are being tempted to use headings out of order.
