## 1. Reusable

<Box css={{display:"flex",alignItems:"start",flexDirection:"row", gap:"$150","@media (max-width: 600px)":{flexDirection:"column-reverse"}}}>
<Box css={{width:"100%"}}>

### Component Reusability

- **Modularity:** Design components should be modular, meaning they can be reused in various parts of the application without being modified.
- **Consistency:** Ensure visual and functional consistency across all platforms and products to foster a unified brand image and enhance user familiarity.
- **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive documentation for each component, detailing its purpose, usage guidelines, and implementation code to facilitate easy adoption by other teams and projects.

## 2. Functional

<Box css={{display:"flex",alignItems:"start",flexDirection:"row", gap:"$150","@media (max-width: 600px)":{flexDirection:"column-reverse"}}}>
<Box css={{width:"100%"}}>

### User-Centered Functionality

- **User Needs:** Prioritize user needs and ensure that every design component serves a clear, user-oriented function.
- **Performance:** Ensure components are optimized for performance, minimizing load times and ensuring smooth interactions.
- **Reliability:** Design components should consistently perform their intended function across all use cases and user flows.

### Responsive and Scalable Design

- **Responsiveness:** Ensure components are designed to provide an optimal user experience across all screen sizes and orientations.
- **Scalability:** Design components should be able to handle variations in content and functionality without compromising user experience or aesthetic appeal.
- **Globalization:** Consider localization and internationalization to ensure the design system is adaptable to different languages and cultures.

### Intuitive and Predictable Interactions

- **Consistency:** Maintain consistent design patterns and interactions across all components and layouts to reduce the user's cognitive load.
- **Feedback:** Provide clear and immediate feedback in response to user actions to confirm outcomes and guide next steps.
- **Guidance:** Implement clear, intuitive wayfinding and familiar ui so users understand and can predict how a component behaves/functions when they see it on our product.

### Inclusive and Accessible Design

- **Universal Design:** Ensure that all components are designed to be usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities.
- **Compliance:** Adhere to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) to ensure that digital content is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
- **Inclusive Imagery and Language:** Utilize imagery and language that reflect diversity and inclusivity, ensuring that all users feel represented and welcomed.
